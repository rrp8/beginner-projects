- Tic Tac Toe

This is my first "finished" project. I don't know how well I've done. I completed this project after watching one course on YouTube, after completing it I realized how much more I need to study and understand basic concepts.

I tried to "steal" as little as possible from StackOverflow, in fact only one line of code (293) has been "stolen" since I didn't even know of the existance of ".join" or "map".

Going forward I want to read a proper book on Python, and learn as much as I can so I can code something worthwhile.

If, by a miracle, you stambled upon this code and have any critisism or advice, go for it. Just, please, don't be too harsh. :)


- Stupid Writer

This was a mistake, I don't know why I did that. I think I just wanted to program something.

- Hangman

I tried my best. Did it in two days. I could add more things and some things don't work, but I don't really care...

- Password Generator

I wanted to do this as an exercise to get back to programming after quite a break. I did it in an hour or two so I'm happy with the result, it also seems to work properly.
